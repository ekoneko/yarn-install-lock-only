# \[WIP\]Yarn install --lock-only

Look like `npm install --package-lock-only`

Yarn doesn't support the feature official([issue 6676](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6676)).

This is a simple implement.

NOTICE: It doesn't anything for [resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) or [flat](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/#toc-yarn-install-flat)
